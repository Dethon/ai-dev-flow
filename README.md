# Claude Code Customizations

Personal collection of agents and skills for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), tailored to fit my preferred workflow.

Heavily inspired by and mostly copied from:

- [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)
- [GantisStorm/essentials-claude-code](https://github.com/GantisStorm/essentials-claude-code)

## Structure

- **agents/** - Custom agent configurations (bug planning, code quality, document creation, etc.)
- **skills/** - All slash commands and reusable skill definitions (planning, implementation, brainstorming, debugging, TDD, etc.)
